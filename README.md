# Blueprints: Kinesis Data Analytics for Apache Flink

## 🗺️ 📐 🛠️ 🏗

Kinesis Data Analytics Blueprints are a curated collection of Apache Flink applications. Each blueprint will walk you through how to solve a practical problem related to stream processing using Apache Flink. These blueprints can be leveraged to create more complex applications to solve your business challenges in Apache Flink, and they are designed to be extensible. We will feature examples for both the DataStream and Table API where possible.

## Get started with Blueprints

Within this repo, you will find examples of Apache Flink applications that can be run locally, on an open source Apache Flink cluster, or on Kinesis Data Analytics Flink cluster.
Clone the repository to get started.

- [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Install and Bootstrap CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html)
- [Install Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
- [Install AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

## How do I use these blueprints?

- To get started with a blueprint, first ensure you have the [necessary prerequisites](#prerequisites) installed.
- Then clone this repo using the command shown below.

```
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-kinesis-data-analytics-blueprints
```
- Open a terminal session and navigate to the [blueprint](#blueprints) of your choice within the project structure; once there, follow the blueprint specific instructions.

### Ensure that npm packages associated with CDK are up to date

1. In the shared CDK folder, run `npm update`.
2. In the CDK folder of your blueprint, run `npm update`.

For example, let's say you want to deploy the MSK to S3 blueprint. Here are the steps you would follow:

Navigate to shared CDK folder (from root of this repo)
```
> cd cdk-infra/shared
> npm update

up to date, audited 457 packages in 12s

30 packages are looking for funding
  run `npm fund` for details

found 0 vulnerabilities
```

Navigate to your blueprint folder (from root of this repo)
```
> cd apps/java-datastream/msk-serverless-to-s3-datastream-java
> npm update

up to date, audited 457 packages in 12s

30 packages are looking for funding
  run `npm fund` for details

found 0 vulnerabilities
```

Now, you're ready to deploy your blueprint.

NOTE: If `npm update` doesn't actually update your dependency versions, you might have to run `npm check update` or `ncu` and manually update the dependency versions in the `package.json` files in each of the above locations.

### Experimentation

- Once you have successfully begun sending data through your blueprint, you have successfully launched and tested a blueprint!
- You can now take the blueprints in this repo, copy them to your own project structure and begin to modify them for your specific needs.
